\title{Dominance Frontiers of a Graph}
\usage{
dominance_frontiers(g, dom_t = dominator_tree(g))
}
\arguments{
\item{g}{(igraph) The graph.}

\item{dom_t}{(igraph) The dominator tree for the graph.}
}
\value{
A graph with a vertex for each vertex in the original graph. Each
vertex has edges to all vertices in its dominance frontier.
}
\description{
This function computes the dominance frontiers for a graph.
}
\details{
The dominance frontier for a block \eqn{b} is the set of all blocks \eqn{y}
such that \eqn{b} dominates a predecessor of \eqn{y} but does not strictly
dominate \eqn{y}. In other words, the dominance frontier for \eqn{b} is the
set of blocks immediately beyond the blocks dominated by \eqn{b}, where
control-flow merges from a separate part of the program.
