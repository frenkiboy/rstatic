Suppose we have some code for an analysis:
```{r}
example1 = function() {
  x = 3
  y = x
  z = x

  # ...
  bar(y)
}
```

We'd like to analyze this code to identify and mark where variables are no
longer needed, so that they can be garbage collected.

To do this, we first use the `to_blocks()` function to get information about
control flow in the sample code.
```{r}
blocks = to_blocks(example1)
```
